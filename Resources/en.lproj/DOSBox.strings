This translation file is based on Boxer 0.88's default DOSBox translation file. A bunch of redundant strings have been removed for ease of translation, and many descriptions have been rewritten with expanded examples.

When translating, ensure that the strings wrap nicely to an 80-column display. DOS does not perform automatic word-wrapping, only character-wrapping.

Strings should also end in a linebreak, unless they are used as a segment of another command.

DOSBox provides CD-ROM emulation on several levels.

The [33mbasic[0m level works on all CD-ROM drives and normal directories.
It installs MSCDEX and marks the files read-only.
Usually this is enough for most games:
[34;1mmount d [0;31mD:\[34;1m -t cdrom[0m   or   [34;1mmount d C:\example -t cdrom[0m
If it doesn't work you might have to tell DOSBox the label of the CD-ROM:
[34;1mmount d C:\example -t cdrom -label CDLABEL[0m

The [33mnext[0m level adds some low-level support.
Therefore only works on CD-ROM drives:
[34;1mmount d [0;31mD:\[34;1m -t cdrom -usecd [33m0[0m

The [33mlast[0m level of support depends on your Operating System:
For [1mWindows 2000[0m, [1mWindows XP[0m and [1mLinux[0m:
[34;1mmount d [0;31mD:\[34;1m -t cdrom -usecd [33m0 [34m-ioctl[0m
For [1mWindows 9x[0m with a ASPI layer installed:
[34;1mmount d [0;31mD:\[34;1m -t cdrom -usecd [33m0 [34m-aspi[0m

Replace [0;31mD:\[0m with the location of your CD-ROM.
Replace the [33;1m0[0m in [34;1m-usecd [33m0[0m with the number reported for your CD-ROM if you type:
[34;1mmount -cd[0m
