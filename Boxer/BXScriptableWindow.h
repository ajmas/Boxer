//BXScriptableWindow is a wrapper for NSWindow which transparently passes KVO scripting messages

//respond to that key (or doesn't exist in the first place). 

//This allows a unified Applescript interface for dealing with a window and its controller as a unit,
//without overloading the window with controller logic.
