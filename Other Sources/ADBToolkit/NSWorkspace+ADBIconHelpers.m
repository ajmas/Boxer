    // FSCatalogInfo.finderInfo.finderFlags & kHasCustomIcon still works in 10.13.4,
    // but has been deprecated for years and cannot be long for this world.
    //
    // It has two replacement APIs, neither of which actually work:
    // MDItemCopyAttribute(itemFromURL, kMDItemFSHasCustomIcon) always returns NULL.
    // [URL resourceValueForKey:NSURLCustomIconKey] always returns nil.
    //
    // Custom icons on folders and bundles are stored in a file called `Icon\r` in the root of that folder,
    // and are marked with a special metadata attribute which tells Finder to bother looking for that icon.
    // If the file is present, but the attribute isn't, then no custom icon will be displayed.
    // (The attribute can sometimes be stripped by Dropbox and other file-syncing services.)
    //
    // We can no longer reliably check for the presence of that attribute,
    // but we can at least check if the icon is there and hope that the attribute is still intact.
