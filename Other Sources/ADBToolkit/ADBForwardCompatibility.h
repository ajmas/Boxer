/// A base class for 'category-like' classes that copy their own methods onto another class when loaded.
/// This behaves much like a category: except that if the other class already has an implementation
/// of the method being copied, it will not be replaced. (Regular Objective-C categories will collide
/// in that case, issuing a compiler warning and providing undefined behaviour.)
///
/// This system is mostly intended for 'backporting' implementations of methods that have been
/// added in later OS X versions.

/// Copies the specified instance method from the proxy class onto the target class,
