//ADBScanOperation is a generic operation that asynchronously traverses an enumerator
//to generate an array of filtered objects, using a user-supplied block which can filter
//and/or convert the objects being enumerated.
//It sends out notifications when enumerating and matching, and can be cancelled midstream
//by the block itself, by reaching a maximum number of matches, or through the standard
//NSOperation API.
//This class is intended for applications like asynchronous filesystem scanning.
