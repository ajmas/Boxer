/// @c ADBMultiPanelWindowController is an @c NSWindowController subclass for managing windows that display
/// one out of a set of different panels. This class provides methods for changing the current panel
/// and animating transitions from one panel to another (resizing the window and crossfading views).
///
/// This is a more flexible and less structured alternative to ADBTabbedWindowController, written back
/// when I was allergic to NSTabView. This provides better animation control (with better crossfades),
/// but for tab-based or toolbar-based windows, @c NSTabbedWindowController is still the better choice.
